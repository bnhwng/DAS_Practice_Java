# Introduction to Data Structures

** Data Structures help us to store and organize data in a computer so that i can be used efficiently

 ** We talk about data structure as Mathematical/logacl models (abstract view)
 For instance, abstract view of a tv is only a device that can be turned on or off, receive signals and show audio video. If we talk about implementation for instance an array then its no longer an array.

- Abstract Data Type (ADT): define data and operations but no implementation. Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph. (logical view, operations, cost of operations (big o), implementation).
- Data type: is system defined type: int, string, float, boolean,...

For instance, dictionary is a sorted list of word. Map data needs to be structured to be able to search for route. 

Different of data needs different structure to be organised.
